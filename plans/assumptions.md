# Assumptions

- Prisma 7 uses `prisma.config.ts` for datasource URL config (not `url` in schema.prisma datasource block)
- Removed `earlyAccess` flag from prisma.config.ts - not a valid config property in current Prisma 7 types
- dotenv/config imported in prisma.config.ts to load DATABASE_URL from .env
- Fixed shadcn sidebar Math.random lint error by using fixed 70% width for skeleton
- Added npm scripts: typecheck (tsc --noEmit), test (placeholder), db:generate, db:push
- CriteriaMapping.description is non-optional String (PRD didn't specify nullability; all EB-1A criteria have descriptions)
- Document.content is optional String (allows inline storage for markdown when S3 not configured, per PRD task 13 note)
- All new fields on existing models use defaults to avoid breaking existing rows (criteriaThreshold=3, phase=ANALYSIS, applicationTypeId=null)
- Template IDs use deterministic `{applicationTypeId}-{type}` format so upserts are idempotent across re-runs
- Seed uses Node 24 `--env-file=.env` instead of dotenv (not a project dependency)
- Template content is placeholder instruction text; will be refined when evidence agent (task 11) is implemented
- Backfill sets all existing null-applicationTypeId cases to EB-1A (only app type currently supported)
- `Criterion` type uses `key` (= criterionKey) for criterion identification in prompts/analysis, `id` for DB relations
- eb1a-agent streaming functions changed from sync to async (callers must await) to support dynamic criteria loading
- analysis API now returns `criteriaNames` map so client components don't need static criteria imports
- `results-modal.tsx` criteriaNames prop is optional; falls back to raw criterionId as display name if not provided
- `lib/eb1a-criteria.ts` retained as deprecated reference file; no consumers import it
- Auto-assign uses spread conditional `...(eb1aType && { applicationTypeId: eb1aType.id })` to avoid setting undefined on the create call
- No auth check in /api/analyze (onboard flow is pre-auth, consistent with existing code pattern)
- Case status PATCH uses hardcoded z.enum(['SCREENING','ACTIVE','EVIDENCE','CLOSED']) rather than importing CaseStatus from Prisma; keeps route self-contained and avoids Prisma enum import quirks
- `updateThreshold` tool uses same 1-10 validation range as the PATCH API (task 5) for consistency
- `runCaseAgent` falls back to threshold=3 if case record not found (defensive, shouldn't happen in practice)
- Threshold is fetched via `select: { criteriaThreshold: true }` to minimize data transfer (not full case record)
- S3 client uses globalThis singleton pattern consistent w/ pinecone.ts
- AWS_S3_BUCKET added as 4th required env var (PRD only listed 3: REGION, ACCESS_KEY_ID, SECRET_ACCESS_KEY) -- bucket name needed for all S3 ops
- `uploadToS3` body accepts `Buffer | ReadableStream` (not Uint8Array/Blob) since these are the types PutObjectCommand accepts
- `buildDocumentKey()` exported as helper for the key convention; not in PRD but avoids key format duplication across consumers
- S3 URL constructed as `https://{bucket}.s3.{region}.amazonaws.com/{key}` (virtual-hosted style, standard for most regions)
- Evidence agent tools create structured markdown templates with context sections, not LLM-generated prose -- the agent itself (via conversation) guides the user through refinement
- `createEvidenceAgentTools` doesn't take `criteria` param (unlike case-agent) since evidence tools don't need criterion key enum validation
- Evidence agent fetches templates via `applicationType.cases` relation to find templates associated with the case's application type
- `draftRecommendationLetter` links to the first criterionKey's CriteriaMapping for the Document.criterionId FK; a future enhancement could support multi-criterion linking
- S3 upload in evidence tools is fire-and-forget with try/catch; if S3 fails the Document record still exists with inline content
- `generateFromTemplate` does simple {{var}} string replacement; does not use a full template engine
- Evidence chat API omits `action: 'initiate'` support (no AI-initiated evidence conversations); analysis chat has it but evidence phase is always user-initiated
- Evidence chat loads DB message history (phase=EVIDENCE) as authoritative source each request, rather than trusting client-sent messages array for conversation continuity
- File upload processing in evidence-chat reuses same pipeline (PDF extract + chunk + embed) as analysis chat; duplicated helper fns rather than extracting shared module to keep routes self-contained
- Document POST accepts .md and .markdown extensions, both map to MARKDOWN DocumentType
- Document record created before S3 upload to generate ID for `buildDocumentKey()`; if S3 upload fails the record still exists (no rollback)
- Non-markdown files without S3 configured: record exists with metadata only, no content stored (user would need to configure S3 for binary file storage)
- GET list endpoint uses `select` to return only summary fields (no content/s3Key); GET detail returns full record + signedUrl
- PATCH accepts optional content/status/name fields via Zod; at least one field required implicitly (empty object is technically valid but no-op)
- DELETE performs S3 cleanup in try/catch; if S3 delete fails, DB record is still removed to avoid orphaned records
- `verifyOwnership` helper is local to [docId]/route.ts, not extracted to shared module (only used in that file's 3 handlers)
- Threshold stepper uses optimistic update pattern: state changes immediately, reverts if PATCH fails (no loading indicator for threshold changes)
- Analysis API response includes `criteriaThreshold` alongside analysis data; ReportPanel propagates threshold changes to parent via `onThresholdChange` callback on refetch
- Onboard results-modal uses default threshold=3 since no case record exists at onboard time (threshold is only configurable post-case-creation)
- Threshold stepper positioned inline within the existing badge pill for compact layout (no separate control area)
- EvidenceChatPanel is a fully independent component (not reusing ChatPanel) because it has different API endpoint, different empty state, and evidence-specific drag-drop; shared ChatInput/MessageItem components are reused
- DocumentsPanel detail view uses inline back button (X) rather than browser navigation; no router state involved
- Analysis messages query now explicitly filters `phase: 'ANALYSIS'` to avoid showing evidence messages in analysis tab; backward-compatible because existing messages have phase=ANALYSIS by default
- PhaseTabs positioned in a top bar above the 60/40 split content area; tab state lives in client.tsx (not URL-based)
- DocumentsPanel does not have a loading indicator for detail fetch (fetch is fast, keeps UI simple)
- Evidence tab re-mounts EvidenceChatPanel when switching tabs; initialMessages from server are used as starting state (subsequent messages from same session are in component state only, will persist on re-mount from server data on next page load)
- Evidence badge uses `onStrongCountChange` callback from ReportPanel rather than computing strongCount independently in client.tsx; avoids duplicating analysis fetch logic
- Badge dismissal (`badgeDismissed`) is session-only; reappears on page reload if threshold still met -- intentional to allow re-entry to evidence phase
- PATCH to set case status=EVIDENCE is fire-and-forget (tab switches regardless); status update is best-effort
- Badge positioned `bottom-20` (80px from bottom) to float above ChatInput; uses absolute positioning within the chat panel column
- Admin sidebar includes /admin/application-types nav link proactively (task 18 page doesn't exist yet); link will 404 until implemented
- Admin layout uses same SidebarProvider + SidebarInset pattern as case layout; no shared layout extraction (admin and case have different sidebars)
- Admin dashboard has no auth guard per PRD resolved decisions; open access for v1
- AdminSidebar active state: exact match for /admin dashboard, startsWith for sub-pages (prevents /admin/criteria from highlighting both Dashboard and Criteria)
- Admin criteria API has no auth guard, consistent with admin layout (task 15) open-access decision
- POST /api/admin/criteria catches Prisma P2002 error code to return 409 on duplicate (applicationTypeId, criterionKey) pairs
- Admin criteria page is a client component (not server) since it needs inline editing state; initial data fetched client-side
- Used useRef didFetch guard to prevent double-fetch in React strict mode and to satisfy react-hooks/set-state-in-effect lint rule
- Active toggle in criteria table works both inline (during edit) and standalone (click toggles + PATCHes immediately); two separate code paths for clarity
- Criteria table groups by applicationTypeId; if multiple app types exist, each gets its own section with header
- Admin templates [id] route includes GET handler (not in PRD steps) since edit page needs to fetch template by id
- Template applicationTypeId is read-only on edit page; changing it could break template-appType relationships and is not a common admin action
- Templates list page uses native `<select>` element instead of shadcn Select (not installed, keeps it simple)
- Content textarea uses monospace font since template content is instruction text / markdown
- Admin templates API has no auth guard, consistent with admin layout (task 15) and criteria API (task 16) open-access decision
